# Quick Start Guide - New Features

## 🚀 Getting Started with the Latest Improvements

## Feature 1: Professional Review Buttons ✨

### What Changed?
When the AI generates code changes to existing files, you'll see a new, professional approval interface.

### How to Use:
1. Open any file in the editor
2. Use voice or text to request changes (e.g., "add error handling")
3. Review the diff in the center editor (red = removed, green = added)
4. Look at the right panel for the approval buttons

### Button Actions:
- **✅ Apply Changes** - Accept and apply the AI's suggestions
- **❌ Reject Changes** - Keep your original code unchanged
- **🔄 Toggle View** - Switch between side-by-side and inline diff

### Visual Style:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍 Review Changes                  │
│  Review the diff and approve/reject │
│                                     │
│  [✅ Apply Changes    ]  ← Green    │
│  [❌ Reject Changes   ]  ← Red      │
│  [🔄 Toggle View      ]  ← Gray     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Feature 2: Smart File Naming 📝

### What Changed?
No more ugly timestamp filenames! Files are now named based on what they do.

### Examples:

| Your Command | Old Filename | New Filename |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| "Create a user authentication module" | `generated_2025-09-30T17-48-46.py` | `user_auth.py` |
| "Build a calculator" | `generated_2025-09-30T17-49-12.py` | `calculator.py` |
| "Implement login feature" | `generated_2025-09-30T17-50-23.py` | `login.py` |
| "Write a data processor" | `generated_2025-09-30T17-51-45.py` | `data_processor.py` |

### How It Works:
The AI analyzes your command and extracts the meaningful parts:
- Recognizes action verbs (create, build, implement, write)
- Identifies the main subject
- Removes filler words
- Formats as snake_case
- Adds the correct file extension

### Supported Languages:
- Python (.py)
- JavaScript (.js)
- TypeScript (.ts)
- HTML (.html)
- CSS (.css)
- Java (.java)
- Go (.go)
- And more!

## Feature 3: Codebase Understanding 🧠

### What Is It?
Like Cursor or Lovable, you can now generate a comprehensive "mental model" of any codebase with one click!

### How to Use:

#### Step 1: Open Your Project
```
1. Click "Open Folder" in the file explorer
2. Select any codebase you want to understand
3. Wait for files to load
```

#### Step 2: Analyze
```
1. Look for the brain icon (🧠) at the top of the file explorer
2. Click it
3. Wait 5-15 seconds for analysis
```

#### Step 3: Review
```
1. The file CODEBASE_MENTAL_MODEL.md will be created
2. It automatically opens in the editor
3. Read and explore your codebase's architecture!
```

### What You Get:

The generated markdown file includes:

```markdown
# Codebase Mental Model

**Generated:** 2025-09-30, 6:07 PM
**Files Analyzed:** 47
**Languages:** .py (23), .js (15), .md (5), .json (4)

---

## 1. Project Overview
A high-level description of what the project does...

## 2. Architecture
Design patterns, architectural style, key abstractions...

## 3. Key Components
Main modules/classes and their responsibilities...

## 4. Technology Stack
Languages, frameworks, tools, dependencies...

## 5. File Organization
How the codebase is structured...

## 6. Entry Points
Where to start reading the code...

## 7. Dependencies & Integration
How components interact...

## 8. Development Workflow
Build, test, deployment processes...
```

### Perfect For:
- ✅ Understanding a new codebase quickly
- ✅ Onboarding new team members
- ✅ Documenting your own projects
- ✅ Getting unstuck when lost in code
- ✅ Planning refactoring efforts

### Tips:
- Works best on projects with < 200 files
- Automatically skips node_modules, venv, .git
- Regenerate anytime to update the analysis
- Use it alongside voice commands for context-aware coding

## Complete Workflow Example

### Scenario: You want to add a new feature to an unfamiliar codebase

```
Step 1: Understand the Codebase
  ↓
  🧠 Click "Analyze Codebase"
  ↓
  📄 Read CODEBASE_MENTAL_MODEL.md
  ↓
  Understand architecture & components

Step 2: Find the Right File
  ↓
  📂 Browse file explorer based on mental model
  ↓
  📝 Open relevant file

Step 3: Make Changes with Voice
  ↓
  🎤 "Add a new authentication method"
  ↓
  ⏳ AI generates code
  ↓
  🔍 Review diff in center editor

Step 4: Approve or Reject
  ↓
  ✅ Click "Apply Changes" if good
  ❌ Click "Reject" if not quite right
  ↓
  💾 Save with Ctrl+S / Cmd+S
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Save current file | `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` |
| Send text command | `Enter` |
| Start/stop recording | Click mic button |

## Troubleshooting

### The buttons don't look transparent?
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Check that CSS is loading properly

### File names are still ugly?
- This only applies to NEW files created after the update
- Existing files keep their names
- Try creating a new file with a clear command

### Codebase analysis is slow?
- Normal for large projects (100+ files)
- Should complete within 15 seconds max
- If stuck, refresh and try again

### Analysis fails?
- Make sure your Gemini API key is configured
- Check that you have an active internet connection
- Verify the folder has readable files

## Need Help?

1. Check the conversation panel for error messages
2. Look at the agent status indicators
3. Try the command with different phrasing
4. Type your command instead of speaking it to debug
